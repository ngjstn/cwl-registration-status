# CWL Registration Status 

## Selenium-based web scraper to *hypothetically* automate course registration and update seat status availability

If you were to *hypothetically* run this script, you would need to install the selenium dependency, which can be done using the command ```pip install selenium```.

You also need a Chromedriver executable, which you could install [here](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads) (this script only has support for Google Chrome Browsers). Make sure to install the correct version corresponding to your browser.
