# Automated CWL Registration Web Scraper 

Selenium-based web scraper to *hypothetically* automate course registration and update seat status availability. 

*dont use it though, it's against UBC ToS >:(* 

If you were to *hypothetically* run this script, you would need to install the python selenium dependency, which can be done using the command ```pip install selenium```. 

You also need a Chromedriver executable, which you could install [here](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads) (this script only supports Google Chrome btw). Make sure to install the correct version corresponding to your browser version. Unzip the installation and place ```chromedriver.exe``` into the directory called ```webdriver```.
